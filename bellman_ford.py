"""
 The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm1 finds shortest paths from a starting node to all
 nodes of the graph. The algorithm can process all kinds of graphs, provided that
 the graph does not contain a cycle with negative length. If the graph contains a
 negative cycle, the algorithm can detect this.
 The algorithm keeps track of distances from the starting node to all nodes
 of the graph. Initially, the distance to the starting node is 0 and the distance to
 all other nodes is infinite. The algorithm reduces the distances by finding edges
 that shorten the paths until it is not possible to reduce any distance.
