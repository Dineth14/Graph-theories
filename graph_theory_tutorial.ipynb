    "A **graph** is a mathematical structure used to model relationships between objects. It consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertices (or Nodes)**: The objects or entities\n",
    "- **Edges**: The connections or relationships between vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Examples:\n",
    "- **Social Networks**: People (vertices) connected by friendships (edges)\n",
    "- **Road Maps**: Cities (vertices) connected by roads (edges)\n",
    "- **Web Pages**: Pages (vertices) connected by hyperlinks (edges)\n",
    "- **Computer Networks**: Computers (vertices) connected by cables (edges)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directed vs Undirected**\n",
    "   - **Undirected**: Edges have no direction (friendship: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A)\n",
    "   - **Directed**: Edges have direction (following on Twitter: A can follow B without B following A)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighted vs Unweighted**\n",
    "   - **Unweighted**: All edges are equal (simple connections)\n",
    "   - **Weighted**: Edges have values/costs (distances, costs, capacities)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connected vs Disconnected**\n",
    "   - **Connected**: There's a path between any two vertices\n",
    "   - **Disconnected**: Some vertices cannot reach others"

    "## 6. Shortest Path Algorithms - SPFA <a id='spfa'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Shortest Path Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a **weighted graph**, find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SPFA: Shortest Path Faster Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "SPFA is an improvement over the Bellman-Ford algorithm. It uses a queue to track vertices that need to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How SPFA Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize distances: source = 0, all others = ∞\n",
    "2. Add source to queue\n",
    "3. While queue is not empty:\n",
    "   - Remove a vertex u from queue\n",
    "   - For each neighbor v of u:\n",
    "     - If distance[u] + weight(u,v) < distance[v]:\n",
    "       - Update distance[v]\n",
    "       - Add v to queue (if not already in queue)\n",
    "4. Detect negative cycles (if a vertex is relaxed too many times)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relaxation**: Updating the distance to a vertex if a shorter path is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if distance[u] + weight(u,v) < distance[v]:\n",
    "    distance[v] = distance[u] + weight(u,v)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative Cycle**: A cycle whose total edge weight is negative. If present, there's no shortest path (you can keep going around the cycle to get infinitely short paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Graph:  0 --(5)--> 1\n",
    "        |          |\n",
    "       (4)       (3)\n",
    "        |          |\n",
    "        v          v\n",
    "        2 --(6)--> 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortest paths from 0:\n",
    "- 0 → 0: 0\n",
    "- 0 → 1: 5\n",
    "- 0 → 2: 4\n",
    "- 0 → 3: 8 (via 0→1→3)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- Average case: O(E) - very fast in practice\n",
    "- Worst case: O(V × E) - same as Bellman-Ford\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Other Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Algorithm | Time | Negative Weights? | Use Case |\n",
    "|-----------|------|-------------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Dijkstra** | O(E log V) | ❌ No | Fastest for non-negative |\n",
    "| **Bellman-Ford** | O(V × E) | ✅ Yes | Guaranteed, but slow |\n",
    "| **SPFA** | O(E) avg | ✅ Yes | Fast in practice |"
