    "\n",
    "A **graph** is a mathematical structure used to model relationships between objects. It consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertices (or Nodes)**: The objects or entities\n",
    "- **Edges**: The connections or relationships between vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Examples:\n",
    "- **Social Networks**: People (vertices) connected by friendships (edges)\n",
    "- **Road Maps**: Cities (vertices) connected by roads (edges)\n",
    "- **Web Pages**: Pages (vertices) connected by hyperlinks (edges)\n",
    "- **Computer Networks**: Computers (vertices) connected by cables (edges)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directed vs Undirected**\n",
    "   - **Undirected**: Edges have no direction (friendship: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A)\n",
    "   - **Directed**: Edges have direction (following on Twitter: A can follow B without B following A)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighted vs Unweighted**\n",
    "   - **Unweighted**: All edges are equal (simple connections)\n",
    "   - **Weighted**: Edges have values/costs (distances, costs, capacities)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connected vs Disconnected**\n",
    "   - **Connected**: There's a path between any two vertices\n",
    "   - **Disconnected**: Some vertices cannot reach others"

    "### The Shortest Path Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a **weighted graph**, find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SPFA: Shortest Path Faster Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "SPFA is an improvement over the Bellman-Ford algorithm. It uses a queue to track vertices that need to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How SPFA Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize distances: source = 0, all others = ∞\n",
    "2. Add source to queue\n",
    "3. While queue is not empty:\n",
    "   - Remove a vertex u from queue\n",
    "   - For each neighbor v of u:\n",
    "     - If distance[u] + weight(u,v) < distance[v]:\n",
    "       - Update distance[v]\n",
    "       - Add v to queue (if not already in queue)\n",
    "4. Detect negative cycles (if a vertex is relaxed too many times)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relaxation**: Updating the distance to a vertex if a shorter path is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if distance[u] + weight(u,v) < distance[v]:\n",
    "    distance[v] = distance[u] + weight(u,v)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative Cycle**: A cycle whose total edge weight is negative. If present, there's no shortest path (you can keep going around the cycle to get infinitely short paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Graph:  0 --(5)--> 1\n",
    "        |          |\n",
    "       (4)       (3)\n",

    "        v          v\n",
    "        2 --(6)--> 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortest paths from 0:\n",
    "- 0 → 0: 0\n",
    "- 0 → 1: 5\n",
    "- 0 → 2: 4\n",
    "- 0 → 3: 8 (via 0→1→3)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Bellman-Ford** is another shortest path algorithm similar to SPFA, but it follows a more systematic approach. It relaxes all edges repeatedly and is guaranteed to find shortest paths even with negative edge weights.\n",

    "### How Bellman-Ford Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize distances: source = 0, all others = ∞\n",
    "2. Repeat (V-1) times:\n",
    "   - For each edge (u, v) with weight w:\n",
    "     - If distance[u] + w < distance[v]:\n",
    "       - Update distance[v] = distance[u] + w\n",
    "3. One more iteration to detect negative cycles\n",
    "   - If any distance can still be reduced, there's a negative cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why V-1 iterations?\n",
    "\n",

    "### All-Pairs Shortest Path\n",
    "\n",
    "While BFS, Bellman-Ford, and SPFA find shortest paths from **one source** to all others, **Floyd-Warshall** finds shortest paths between **all pairs** of vertices at once!\n",

    "### How Floyd-Warshall Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses **dynamic programming** with a brilliant insight: \n",
    "\n",
    "For every pair of vertices (i, j), consider all possible intermediate vertices k. If going through k gives a shorter path, update the distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Steps:**\n",

    "     - If distance[i,k] + distance[k,j] < distance[i,j]:\n",

    "### The Key Idea:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Can we go from i to j faster by going through k?\n",

    "\n",
    "### Historical Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "The famous **Seven Bridges of Königsberg** problem (1736):\n",
    "- City had 7 bridges connecting 4 land areas\n",
    "- Question: Can you walk crossing each bridge exactly once?\n",
    "- Leonhard Euler proved it's impossible!\n",
    "- This created graph theory as a field\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditions for Eulerian Paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Undirected Graphs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eulerian Circuit exists** if:\n",

    "   - Graph is connected  \n",
    "   - Exactly **2 vertices have odd degree**\n",
    "   - Path must start and end at these odd-degree vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Eulerian Path** if:\n",
    "   - More than 2 vertices have odd degree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about entering and leaving vertices:\n",
    "- Each time you pass through a vertex, you use 2 edges (one in, one out)\n",

    "1. **Graphs** model relationships: vertices (objects) connected by edges (relationships)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Representations**:\n",
    "   - Adjacency List: Memory-efficient, good for sparse graphs\n",
    "   - Adjacency Matrix: Fast edge lookup, good for dense graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Traversal Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - **BFS**: Level by level, shortest path in unweighted graphs\n",
    "   - **DFS**: Deep first, good for connectivity and cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Shortest Path**:\n",
    "   - **SPFA**: Efficient for weighted graphs, handles negative weights\n",
    "   - Detects negative cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use What?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Need shortest path (unweighted)?** → BFS\n",
    "- **Need to explore all vertices?** → DFS or BFS\n",
    "- **Need shortest path (weighted)?** → SPFA or Dijkstra\n",
    "- **Have negative weights?** → SPFA or Bellman-Ford\n",
    "- **Need to find cycles?** → DFS\n",
    "- **Need to find connected components?** → DFS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with small graphs and trace through algorithms manually\n",
    "2. Draw graphs on paper to visualize the problem\n",
    "3. Implement the basic algorithms from scratch\n",
